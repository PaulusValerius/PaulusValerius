## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
In 2010, I graduated from Kemerovo University with a degree in applied mathematics and informatics.
During my studies, I wrote code in C# and Java.
Currently, I am learning Python and machine learning skills.
This repository is created to add my projects and format my resume.
As my knowledge deepens, the repository content and its quality will change.
